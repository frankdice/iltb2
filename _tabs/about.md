Iâ€™m just a nerd with too much time on my hands. This site started as a way for me to practice coding and web development. I've started numerous coding projects in the past and almost all of them were swiftly abandoned after I lost interest or got busy. This time, in an attempt to keep myself focused, I decided to incorporate my favorite hobby, Dungeons & Dragons. My dream is to grow this site into a robust set of tools and resources that TTRPG players everywhere can use to create amazing adventures with their friends. Thank you for being here and for helping me make that dream a reality. Happy looting!
