The [magic item generator](/generators/magic-item-generator.html) has changed a lot since its first iteration and will continue to change as I get feedback, learn new skills, and have new ideas. Some of these changes have resulted in the addition of new options and modifiers you can select to alter the items it generates. The sections below describe these additional options so you can make best use of them.

If you have suggestions for ways to improve the generators or specific feature requests then please let me know! I love getting feedback and I want to make this tool something that people will actually use. The option to add curses was actually a suggestion from a comment on Reddit so I do actually take your feedback to heart!

## Show Price

The 'Show Price' option allows you toggle on/off the suggested price of each item. When selected, the generator will display the suggested price as part of the item details (the italicized line just under the item name). The price is calculated by taking the base price of the selected item and adding a random number (within a range) based on the selected magical effect's [power level](/posts/magic-item-generator-power-levels/). For example, let's say the generator spits out a shortsword with a medium-power magical effect. The price for that item would be the shortsword's base value of 10gp plus a random number in the medium power level's range (20gp-300gp). The final price would lie somewhere between 30gp and 310gp.

## Add Curse

The 'Add Curse' option allows you to add an additional curse effect to a magic item. When selected, the generator will display each item's normal magical effect along with an additional curse effect just below it.

Note: Selecting the 'Add Curse' option will deselect the 'Curse' power level option. I felt that it would be silly to have a an already cursed item with an additional curse.
